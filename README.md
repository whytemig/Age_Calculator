Coding an age calculator in JavaScript
Introduction
This README file provides an explanation of how to code an age calculator using JavaScript. The age calculator will take a user's birthdate as input and calculate their current age in years, months, and days.

How to Use
To use the age calculator, follow these steps:

Open the HTML file in your web browser.
Enter your birthdate in the provided input field in "YYYY-MM-DD".
Click the "Calculate Age" button.
The calculated age will be displayed below the button.

Errors with Calculating Month and Day Difference
Ignoring Leap Years: The current code doesn't account for leap years, which leads to inaccurate age calculations. Leap years have an extra day, so the average number of days in a year should consider that (365.25 days).

Inaccurate Month Calculation: The code approximates the number of months by dividing the number of days by 30.44. However, this assumes that each month has precisely 30.44 days, which is not accurate. Months have varying lengths, so this approach can lead to discrepancies.

Day Calculation Rounding Errors: The method for calculating months also affects the accuracy of the remaining days. As the number of days in a month is an integer, converting it to a floating-point number can introduce rounding errors.
